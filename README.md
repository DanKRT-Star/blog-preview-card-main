## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I practiced using local fonts with @font-face, used Flexbox for layout alignment, and applied hover states for interactive elements. I also learned how to use CSS variables to manage colors and style guides more efficiently.

Example of using @font-face:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 100 950;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing responsive design, optimizing accessibility, and experimenting more with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - Reference for embedding custom fonts.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - A very intuitive game to practice Flexbox.
